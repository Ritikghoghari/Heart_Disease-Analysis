Heart Disease Data Analysis Project

The Heart Disease Data Analysis Project explores patterns and insights related to heart disease, examining various factors such as age, gender, cholesterol, and other health metrics. The goal is to identify trends and relationships that could contribute to predicting heart disease.

Dataset
The data is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of several key features:

Age: Age of the individual
Sex: Gender of the individual (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
CP (Chest Pain Type): 0-3 representing different pain types
Trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure): Resting blood pressure in mm Hg
Chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
FBS (Fasting Blood Sugar): > 120 mg/dl (1 = True, 0 = False)
Restecg (Resting ECG Results): 0-2 representing different results
Thalach (Max Heart Rate Achieved)
Exang (Exercise-Induced Angina): 1 = Yes, 0 = No
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
CA: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
Thal: 3 = Normal, 6 = Fixed Defect, 7 = Reversible Defect
Target: 1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Heart Disease

Data Analysis
Key steps in the analysis:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and correcting data formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Correlation Matrix: Examines relationships between features.
  Heart Disease Incidence: Distribution of individuals with/without heart disease.
  Gender Analysis: Distribution of gender, including gender-specific incidence of heart disease.
  Age Distribution: Analysis of the age range of individuals.


Results

Descriptive Analysis: 
  Summary statistics, distributions, and feature correlations.
Visualizations: 
  Insights on age, gender, cholesterol, and other factors influencing heart disease.
